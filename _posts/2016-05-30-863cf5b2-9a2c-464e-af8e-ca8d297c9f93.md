After a slightly longer spell in hospital than we'd planned, we finally got to take little Yuli home late on Wednesday evening. She'd spent a bit of time getting used to being in the outside world and her desire to milk hadn't kicked in. The wonderful docs and midwives at Croydon University Hospital did an amazing job looking after Jane and Yuli.
