When I was a young girl...

Coming from a family of devout Crystal Palace supporters, unfortunately there is no choice for little Yuli as to who she is going to have to support. A lifetime of hope, excitement and ultimately plenty of frustration. Todays defeat to Man Utd being a prime example. If we stick to schedule I'll be going with her to Wembley when she is 26 years old to our next FA Cup Final appearance. Third time lucky?
