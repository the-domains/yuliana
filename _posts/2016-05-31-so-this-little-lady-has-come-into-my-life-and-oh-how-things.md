I've done things for myself (and obviously my wife) but now everything is about Yuli. From the moment I wake up it’s all about looking after her and making her smile. It’s a strange feeling and it’s weird how quickly things have changed but I now can’t imagine life without her. She’s just the best thing in the world. "

So this little lady has come into my life and oh how things have changed. I suddenly feel like the first 35 years of my life have been so selfish. I've done things for myself (and obviously my wife) but now everything is about Yuli. From the moment I wake up it's all about looking after her and making her smile. It's a strange feeling and it's weird how quickly things have changed but I now can't imagine life without her. She's just the best thing in the world.
