It's been just 74 days since Yuli arrived. Such a short time but so much has happened. She's already changed so much and, as you can tell from the photos, grown so much. The growth charts are spiking and she's already wearing clothes beyond her age and pushing the limits of fitting into her Moses basket. That in itself represents a slight problem for us as advice says to keep babies in your room for the first 6 months but we might need to move her into her own room before she reaches 3\.

Each day she seems to get more and more responsive and we genuinely get the impressions that she loves getting up in the morning. She just looks so exited and interested in everything. I think the thing I love the most is the way Yuli enjoys having her own little conversation with us. It's a bit like talking to a Wookie but it's just the most adorable thing. Yesterday she seemed to realise that her hands were her own and has started rubbing her eyes when she is tired and trying to suck her hands when she is hungry. Just so sweet.
