Newborn babies sleep all of the time. This is what we were told.

They sleep up to 18 hours a day.

Well... that wasn't our early experiences of our Yuli for the first few days and weeks. Initially, she'd got herself into a bit of a muddle and got her day and night mixed up. She therefore didn't have any intention of sleeping during the night. Upsettingly though, she didn't have much intention of sleeping during the day either.

What she did want to do though was cry. A lot. The sort of heart breaking pained scream that cuts straight through you. I hadn't really prepared myself for how much it would affect me but hearing our little girl cry her heart out and seemingly not be able to do anything to fix it was just horrible.

Luckily, with time, she has settled right down now and we're in a decent sleeping routine. It felt like we would never reach it during those first few weeks but with slow progress we've got there. There are still times when Yuli loses it and 'that cry' comes out but thankfully it's a lot less.
