# Sleepy head

So... sleep. Something I used to complain I didn't have enough of. Oh how lucky I was. 

In fairness little Yui is actually pretty good. Once she's asleep she's staying asleep for pretty long spells and her night time feeds tend to be brief and followed by more sleep. The recent problem has been getting her to sleep. She's started having a bit of a melt down between 7pm and 9pm and just seems to cry (or more specifically scream) with nothing settling her. It's tough as you want to be able to help the little lady and being so helpless is just horrible. We're consoling ourselves in the knowledge that she is a very happy baby at all other times and we don't think she is actually in any real major pain. It doesn't make it a whole lot easier but I really feel for the couples that have to deal with crying babies for longer stretches that we are currently coping with. 

From everything we've read, and the internet is great for providing endless forums of parents complaining and coming up with theories, our best guess is that it's just a phase as she's learning so many new things. Hopefully a phase that doesn't last too long.
